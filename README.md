  Sangreal Media is a startup company with the aim of advertising and marketing newly-minted NFTs. This site is meant to detail the company's vision, services, and main contact information in order to recruit new clients. Eventually, the goal is for the site to allow users to view different products, fill out a contact form {selecting the company's needs, estimating the budget, etc.}, and request an availability-based meeting time.
